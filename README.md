# Centralized-Lab-Equipment
This project implements a distributed laboratory equipment control system using Ethernet as the primary communication backbone. The system consists of a central MacBook computer connected to multiple laboratory peripherals via an Ethernet switch. Two laboratory instruments are controlled: a smart hot plate with precision temperature regulation and a centrifuge with variable speed control.

Ethernet_Test_Hotplate contains code for the hotplate. 
Ethernet_Test_Echo contains code for the centrifuge.
